Assignment No. 8
Implementing a Bit of Scrabble with Drag-and-Drop

I think I finished this assignment 75%

all the fundamental functions are working fine, there is a list of functions I didn't finish on time.

1. have to reload the web for a new game, which means the card won't refresh until the user reload.
2. since have to reload web content for a new game, there is no function for calculating cumulative scores.
3. lack the function of checking the correctness of spelling words with dictionary.
